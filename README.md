TreniQue-BoutiQue
I am in the beginning stages of opening up a new boutique and I'm looking for people to join the marketing of finding new/unique/creative/one of a kind brands to help shape my site. I want to make a mini market place with brands in all avenues, clothing, art, household goods, skin care, accessories , etc. 
Clothing brand such as eco-friendly, urban/street wear, vintage, bohemian, and any brand with new concepts and new ideas for fresh new looks in fashion!
